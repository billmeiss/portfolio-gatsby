> My booking app is open source and was created as a learning tool for other developers to use. 
> I implemented user authentication and CRUD operations for both users and appointments.
> It's powered by Next.js and MongoDB. The mobile-first UI was designed using TailwindCSS, a powerful tool for UI design.
